"Testing Spatial Data Deliverance in SQL and NoSQL Database Using NodeJS Fullstack Web App","D.

Most of which coming from GPS-enabled devices available for general consumers. The large amount of geotagged data coined the term `Geospatial Big Data', indicating the semi-structured and unstructured nature of such data. SQL relational databases have been known in the past to handle geospatial data very well. However, the abundance of geospatial big data pushed forward the need for NoSQL database which is expected to perform better in terms of handling and storing geospatial big data. This paper discusses the quantitative comparison of performance between the SQL (i.e., PostGIS) and NoSQL (i.e., MongoDB) databases in handling geospatial big data. A NodeJS-based angular-framework web app was developed to test the real-world performance of MongoDB and PostGIS in handling a large amount of simulated geospatial data. A different number of points were generated for testing the geospatial data storing and loading capability of both the databases. The test was conducted by comparing the result of XHR (XML HTTP Request) of both databases in each case. The result showed that NoSQL database, i.e. MongoDB, performs better in loading big geospatial data compared to traditional SQL database using PostGIS.","","978-1-5386-5813-0","10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8528705","NoSQL;MongoDB;PostGIS","Spatial databases;Geospatial analysis;NoSQL databases;Testing;Big Data;Loading","Big Data;data analysis;geographic information systems;Global Positioning System;relational databases;SQL;visual databases;Web sites;XML","NoSQL database;geotagged data;SQL relational databases;geospatial data storing;loading big geospatial data;SQL database;NodeJS-based angular-framework Web app;NodeJS fullstack Web app;geospatial Big Data;testing spatial data deliverance;GPS-enabled devices;XHR;XML HTTP request;MongoDB;PostGIS","","2","","12","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increased amount of data received, the performance of data retrieval using traditional RDBMS often decreased significantly. Also, storing geospatial data in traditional RDBMS or NoSQL lead to persistence of data, which is not required when tracking ship position, as majority of ship always moving. The increased amount of ship shown in monitoring map make it less informative, hence affecting users who use monitoring system.

Traditional relational databases reveal limitations in handling such big geospatial data, mainly due to their rigid schema requirements and limited scalability. Numerous NoSQL databases have emerged and actively serve as alternative data stores for big spatial data. Benchmarks play a crucial role in evaluating NoSQL databases and provide decision-makers with trustworthy information to choose the most suitable data store for applications. In this study, we present a framework to evaluate the performance and scalability of geospatial NoSQL databases, called GeoYCSB. We extend YCSB, a de facto benchmark framework for NoSQL systems, by integrating new components to its design architecture and also by implementing geospatial workloads. We use GeoYCSB to evaluate two leading document stores, MongoDB and Couchbase, which support geospatial queries. GeoYCSB is extensible and can be used to evaluate any NoSQL databases for geospatial workloads, provided they support spatial queries.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005570","Big Geospatial Data;Geospatial Query;Benchmark;Performance Evaluation;Scalability;NoSQL Databases;MongoDB;Couchbase","Geospatial analysis;NoSQL databases;Benchmark testing;Scalability;Servers;Indexes;Big Data","Big Data;data analysis;geographic information systems;NoSQL databases;query processing;relational databases;visual databases","GeoYCSB;NoSQL systems;geospatial NoSQL databases;big spatial data;geospatial data;relational databases;geospatial workloads;geospatial queries","","","","20","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, one of the key issues is the veracity and therefore the data quality. Indeed, as with classic data, geospatial big data are generally fuzzy even though they are stored as crisp data (perfect data). Hence, if data are geospatial and fuzzy, additional complexities appear because of the complex syntax and semantic features of such data. The NoSQL databases do not offer strict data consistency. Therefore, new challenges are needed to be overcome to develop efficient methods that simultaneously ensure the performance and the consistency in storing fuzzy geospatial big data. This paper presents a new methodology that tackles the storage issues and validates the fuzzy spatial entities’ consistency in a document-based NoSQL system. Consequently, first, to better express the structure of fuzzy geospatial data in such a system, we present a logical model called Fuzzy GeoJSON schema. Second, for consistent storage, we implement a schema-driven pipeline based on the Fuzzy GeoJSON schema and semantic constraints.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2725904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7974765","Spatial databases;data storage representations;schema and subschema;fuzzy set;imprecision;consistency;big data;NoSQL systems;JSON","Fuzzy sets;Geospatial analysis;Big Data;Data models;NoSQL databases;Spatial databases;Fuzzy set theory","","","","1","","43","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BIM is associated with the integration of spatial and semantic information on the various stages of urban building. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution characteristics of BIM geospatial big data, a data storage and management model is proposed for BIM geospatial big data management. The architecture primarily includes Not only Structured Query Language (NoSQL) database and distributed peer-to-peer storage. The evaluation of the proposed storage method is conducted on the same software platform as our previous research about WebVR. The experimental results show that the hybrid storage architecture proposed in this research has a lower response time compared to the traditional relational database in geospatial big data searches.

Whether these applications are newly developed or they are being evolved from existing RDBMS-based implementations, NoSQL databases offer an attractive platform with which to address this challenge. However, developers find it difficult to effectively manage data in NoSQL databases, because these platforms do not offer much support for data organization. Since poor data organization may abuse the features of the NoSQL database and result in unsatisfactory performance, developing a systematic method for NoSQL database data-schema design is a timely and important problem. In this paper, we focus on geospatial applications, as a family of big-data systems with distinct data types and usage patterns, in need of scalability. We propose the HGrid data model for HBase, based on a hybrid index structure, combining a quad-tree and a regular grid as primary and secondary indices correspondingly. We have comparatively evaluated the performance of HGrid with uniform and skewed data, against two other data models based on quad-tree and regular-grid indices. Our results demonstrate that HGrid scales well and supports efficient performance for range and k-nearest neighbor queries. Although this model does not outperform all its competitors in terms of query response time, it is more flexible for discontinuous and skewed space, and its index requires less space than the corresponding quad-tree and regular-grid indices, which makes its deployment possible with less resources. Through this study, we also formulate a set of guidelines on how to organize data for geospatial applications in HBase.","2159-6190","978-0-7695-5028-2","10.1109/CLOUD.2013.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740243","Data Model;Data Schema;Geospatial Data Set;HBase;Coprocessor","Data models;Indexes;Tiles;Geospatial analysis;Coprocessors;Organizations","Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;data models;database indexing;grid computing;quadtrees;query processing;relational databases;visual databases","data types;usage patterns;HGrid data model;hybrid index structure;quad-tree;regular grid;uniform data;skewed data;k-nearest neighbor queries;query response time;big-data systems;geospatial application;NoSQL database data-schema design;data organization;data management;RDBMS-based implementation;data analysis;data collection;cloud-based infrastructures;HBase;large geospatial data sets","","24","","15","","17 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ever increasing observations and measurements of geo-sensor networks, satellite imageries, point clouds from laser scanning, geospatial data of Location Based Services (LBS) and location-based social networks has become a serious challenge for data management and analysis systems. Traditionally, Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) were used to manage and to some extent analyze the geospatial data. Nowadays these systems can be used in many scenarios but there are some situations when using these systems may not provide the required efficiency and effectiveness. More specifically when the geospatial data has high volume, high frequency of change (in both data content and data structure) and variety of structures, the conventional data storage systems cannot provide needed efficiency in online systems in terms of performance and scalability. In these situations, NoSQL solutions can provide the efficiency necessary for applications using geospatial data. This paper provides an overview of the characteristics of geospatial big data, possible solutions for managing and processing them. Then the paper provides an overview of the major types of NoSQL solutions, their advantages and disadvantages and the challenges they present in managing geospatial big data.

Geohashing is a popular way to convert a latitude/longitude spatial point into a code/string and has used for storing data into buckets of the grid. Many methods of handling big geospatial data, especially NoSQL databases, are based on the geohashing techniques. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to encode/decode 3D point cloud in a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) that represents the Earth as hierarchical sequences of equal area/volume tessellations, similar to geohash. The current geohash of base36 has the difficulties of working with high-resolution 3D point clouds for data storage, filter, integration, and analytics because of its limitation of cell size and unequal areas. We employ DGGS-based Morton codes with more than 64 bits for precise 3D coordinates of point cloud and compare the encoding/decoding performance between two implementations: using strings and using the combination of bit interleaving and lookup tables.","2375-9356","978-1-5386-7789-6","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2019.8679177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8679177","Big data management;3D point cloud;Discrete Global Grid System;Morton order","Three-dimensional displays;Geospatial analysis;Face;Earth;Laser radar;Encoding;Databases","Big Data;cloud computing;computational geometry;data analysis;database management systems;decoding;encoding;file organisation;geographic information systems;geophysics computing;mobile robots;public domain software;solid modelling;table lookup","massive point cloud data;three-dimensional urban space modeling;database management system;big data;data partitioning;latitude/longitude spatial point;big geospatial data;encode/decode 3D;high-resolution 3D point clouds;NoSQL databases;geohashing technique;discrete global grid system;data storage;data filter;data integration;data analytics;lookup tables","","","","21","","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of NoSQL databases in the construction of GDW is still an unexplored topic, even though NoSQL databases present good performance and high scalability with low-cost hardware. In this context, we seek to identify the level of redundancy of geospatial data in Document-Oriented GDW (DGDW) that reduces the storage cost and increases the performance of SOLAP queries. Using the MongoDB database, we exhaustively define and investigate nine DGDW schemas, which have different levels of geospatial data redundancy in their dimensions. We performed an experimental evaluation of these schemas in a cluster structure, to analyze the data volume and the runtime of seven queries which simulate SOLAP operations in geospatial fields with different levels of redundancy and selectivity. Our experimental results indicate that the normalization of low-selectivity geospatial fields and the denormalization of high-selectivity geospatial fields are good strategies to reduce the storage cost and improve the performance of SOLAP queries. The results of our experimental evaluation are an important contribution because they can be used as a guide for construction of DGDW.","2378-1971","978-1-7281-0650-2","10.1109/CBI.2019.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8808080","Geospatial Data Warehouse;Big Data;NoSQL;Experimental Evaluation","Geospatial analysis;Unified modeling language;Redundancy;NoSQL databases;Data warehouses;Informatics","data mining;data warehouses;decision making;geographic information systems;query processing;visual databases","NoSQL databases;low-cost hardware;storage cost;SOLAP queries;MongoDB database;DGDW schemas;geospatial data redundancy;data volume;SOLAP operations;low-selectivity geospatial fields;high-selectivity geospatial fields;decision-making process;document-oriented geospatial data warehouse;document-oriented GDW;online analytical processing queries","","","","30","","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ease of using these sensors is increasing as much as their variety. Generally, sensors provide information about various aspects of the real world. Sensors are used for gathering environmental information such as changes in temperature, air pressure, water quality. Sensors are also used widely in diagnosing automobiles, traffic patterns, health care and disaster management. The important task is to analyze the large amount of multidimensional data generated by diverse sensors and interoperability among various system which handles such complex data. These sensors are distributed geographically and these sensor networks do not take context information into account due to which they provide heterogeneous interfaces to access the data. To handle these issues we need to give greater importance to the interoperability of the data acquired from heterogeneous and distributed network of sensors. In this paper, we are going to propose an architecture using which the sensor data can be exposed as a service over the web. Our architecture will also take the user location into account in order to provide weather data from the nearest available sensors. We are going to use RESTful web services as it is simple, reliable and easily scalable. We are also going to use a document oriented NoSQL database.

The techniques are illustrated via worked examples that have been deployed live on geospatial data from the transportation domain. This draws upon a real-world case study in intelligent transportation looking at on-demand, real-time predictions of flows of train movements across the UK rail network. Evaluation of the proposed techniques shows the response time, for varying volumes of queries involving prediction, to remain almost constant (at 50 ms), even as the database scales up to the 250M entries. The query response time is important in this context as the target is predicting train delays. It is even more important in a serverless environment due to the stringent constraints on serverless functions' runtime before timeout. The similarities of a serverless environment to other resource constrained environments (e.g., IoT, telecoms) means the techniques can be applied to a range of use cases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985282","EIT Digital IVZW through the Real-Time Flow Project(grant numbers:18387–SGA201); EPSRC IAA Project AGELink(grant numbers:EP/R511791/1); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055400","Intelligent transportation;predicting train delays;AWS;functions as-a-service;Lambda;NoSQL;serverless;resource-constrained;serverless codebase optimization;rail traffic big data","Libraries;Load modeling;Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Predictive models;Optimization","intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;query processing;railways","data storage;geospatial data;intelligent transportation;train movements;UK rail network;query response time;train delays;serverless functions;resource constrained environments;serverless deployment;large-scale AI workloads;optimization techniques;generic AI codebase;restricted serverless environment;local temporary storage;serverless function invocation;inference;ONNX model formatting;pretrained AI/ML models","","2","","46","CCBY","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whilst there is enormous potential for applications that exploit this data in real-time, storing and querying it in real-time creates significant challenges. Traditional RDBMS systems are not sufficiently scalable, while typical cloud-based solutions such as map-reduce do not possess the capabilities required for real-time, spatial-data processing. Therefore, new approaches are needed. In this paper we explore the use of NoSQL technologies. These offer scalability, availability and fault tolerance, but -- as we show -- do not perform well with spatial data. Therefore, in this paper we address this challenge by enhancing existing spatial indexing structures with novel algorithms for inserting and searching spatial data. We have implemented this in a NoSQL solution (Antares), and evaluated it against two other NoSQL solutions, and a range of indexing structures: Kd-Tree, Quad Tree and Geohashing.
