So there is requirement to study the weather and climate variability at very high resolution in multiple spatial and temporal scales. Presently climate data are huge in size as more data are being generated compared to past. Also sophisticated models are being used for prediction of weather and climate variability, generating vast amount of multidimensional digital data. As such climate data is considered to be big data which is multi-dimensional, multi-approach and multisource. So the demand of high performance computing and cloud computing is being increased to do the climate research. This paper gives an outline of a few strategies in supporting big data administration and investigation in geoscience domain for climate studies. By analyzing contemporary information technologies and approaches, it can confirm what operational program framework and approaches are at hand and pertinent in developing big data-driven climate research. A transitory overview of HBase for storing and managing notable geoscience data across distributed machinery is highlighted. Withal MapReduce-predicated techniques to fortify parallel access of massive NetCDF data are considered. The outcomes can recognize basic issues and enhances the proficiency of dissecting huge geoscience information by lessening information preparing time.","","978-1-5090-1066-0","10.1109/CESYS.2016.7889855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889855","HBase;MapReduce;NetCDF;Multidimensional;Temporal Scale","Meteorology;Big Data;Geospatial analysis;Data integration;Crowdsourcing;Cloud computing","Big Data;climatology;cloud computing;geophysics computing","Big data research;climate science;climate research;climate variability;multiple spatial;temporal scales;climate data;multidimensional digital data;high performance computing;cloud computing;Big data administration;geoscience domain;information technologies;operational program framework;distributed machinery;geoscience information","","3","","22","","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to deal with the growing spatial data, a high performance spatial data processing system layered on big data technologies is needed. In this paper, we present an approach to process big spatial data with Apache Spark, a fast and generic engine for large-scale data processing. We developed a software development kit named SparkSpatialSDK, which takes spatial characteristics of geospatial data into consideration and provides a Spark-enabled spatial data structure and API to allow users easily perform spatial analyses with big spatial data. The spatial data structure couples geometric data structure (point, line, and polygon) with Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD). An interface, called SpatialRDD, is provided to access big spatial data stored in distributed database systems like HBase and load the data in Spark processing engine. We illustrates the applications of the API using some example processing functions such as the spatial range and spatial k-nearest neighbor queries. The results demonstrate the applicability of using SparkSpatialSDK for big geospatial data processing.","","978-1-5386-3884-2","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8047039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8047039","Big Spatial Data;Apache Spark;SpatialRDD;SparkSpatialSDK","Spatial databases;Sparks;Distributed databases;Geospatial analysis;Data processing;Software;Spatial indexes","application program interfaces;Big Data;distributed databases;query processing;software engineering;spatial data structures","big spatial data processing;apache spark;big data technologies;high performance spatial data processing system;large-scale data processing;spatial characteristics;Spark processing engine;spatial range;spatial k-nearest neighbor queries;big geospatial data processing;spatial data structure;geometric data structure;SpatialRDD;API;SparkSpatialSDK;resilient distributed datasets;RDD;distributed database systems;HBase;software development kit","","3","","17","","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatial data is also being generated from many other geo-spatial applications. To address the challenge of data volume, a number of big spatial data management systems have emerged that are based on the MapReduce paradigm. Recent projects have developed spatial data systems using Spark's distributed in-memory architecture. These projects, which include GeoSpark, SpatialSpark, and LocationSpark, do not support the high update rates required by LBS applications. Alternatively, systems such as MD-HBase support data updates, but are hindered by the performance characteristics of HBase, which is a disk-oriented framework. We present DISTIL+, a distributed spatio-temporal data processing system designed for high velocity location data. Our system achieves high update throughput and low query latency by leveraging the APGAS (Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space) architecture to build a multi-level distributed in-memory index. We present extensive experimental evaluation of our system, comparing several indexing and data placement schemes, as well as competing systems.

Whether these applications are newly developed or they are being evolved from existing RDBMS-based implementations, NoSQL databases offer an attractive platform with which to address this challenge. However, developers find it difficult to effectively manage data in NoSQL databases, because these platforms do not offer much support for data organization. Since poor data organization may abuse the features of the NoSQL database and result in unsatisfactory performance, developing a systematic method for NoSQL database data-schema design is a timely and important problem. In this paper, we focus on geospatial applications, as a family of big-data systems with distinct data types and usage patterns, in need of scalability. We propose the HGrid data model for HBase, based on a hybrid index structure, combining a quad-tree and a regular grid as primary and secondary indices correspondingly. We have comparatively evaluated the performance of HGrid with uniform and skewed data, against two other data models based on quad-tree and regular-grid indices. Our results demonstrate that HGrid scales well and supports efficient performance for range and k-nearest neighbor queries. Although this model does not outperform all its competitors in terms of query response time, it is more flexible for discontinuous and skewed space, and its index requires less space than the corresponding quad-tree and regular-grid indices, which makes its deployment possible with less resources. Through this study, we also formulate a set of guidelines on how to organize data for geospatial applications in HBase.","2159-6190","978-0-7695-5028-2","10.1109/CLOUD.2013.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740243","Data Model;Data Schema;Geospatial Data Set;HBase;Coprocessor","Data models;Indexes;Tiles;Geospatial analysis;Coprocessors;Organizations","Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;data models;database indexing;grid computing;quadtrees;query processing;relational databases;visual databases","data types;usage patterns;HGrid data model;hybrid index structure;quad-tree;regular grid;uniform data;skewed data;k-nearest neighbor queries;query response time;big-data systems;geospatial application;NoSQL database data-schema design;data organization;data management;RDBMS-based implementation;data analysis;data collection;cloud-based infrastructures;HBase;large geospatial data sets","","24","","15","","17 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These data is often categorized together according to a relatively simple way, thus forming a number of datasets with complex internal structure. However, this is not a good expression of rich geoscience information carried by unstructured data and it is also inconvenient to express complex relationships among the information, even against to find in-depth knowledge across datasets. Meanwhile, existence forms of such data also impeded the application of advanced technological methods. In an attempt to solve the problem, this paper proposes a multi-granularity content tree model and pay-as-you-go mode to support evolvement data modeling. These features help to split the data model, position data content precisely and to expand the dimensions of the main features that described according to the data subject, and then gradually discover data contained information and relationships among the information. Considering the large size of the data features, this paper designs data persistence mode based on HBase, so as to achieve the purpose of data processing by using technologies within the Hadoop system. This article also presents data content extraction and content tree initial state algorithms under MapReduce framework, and dynamic loading and local caching algorithms of content tree, thus forming a basic extract-store-load process.

A NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database is simple in design and can store terabytes of data with finer control over availability. NoSQL databases such as Hbase are widely used in big data and real-time applications. In Hbase, data is present in a collection of key-value pairs and each possible key is unique in the collection. we present the index structure using quad tree over Hbase which can insert large number of multidimensional data based on location and response time of nearest neighbor queries as lower than traditional Relational DBMS system.","","978-1-4799-6818-3","10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7193237","multidimensional data;key-value store;hbase;location based applications;Nosql database","Indexes;Conferences;Mobile communication;Servers;Geospatial analysis;Query processing","Big Data;query processing;relational databases;SQL","nearest neighbor queries;response time;multidimensional data;quad tree;key-value pairs;big data;Hbase;Not Only SQL database;NOSQL databases;RDBM;relational database management systems;specialized servers;client server architecture;real time querying requirements;database application challenge","","1","","21","","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
